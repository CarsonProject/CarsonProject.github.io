			<h2>Theme</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>The theme of Into The Wild is that rejection to the American materialistic view is a beneficial step into becoming a happy person for some people, but ultimately every person has their own goals and aspirations that will make them happy.</p><br>
			
			<p>“One of his last acts was to take a picture of himself, standing near the bus under the high Alaska sky, one hand holding his final note toward the camera lens, the other raised in a brave, beatific farewell. His face is horribly emaciated, almost skeletal. But if he pitied himself in those last difficult hours—because he was so young, because he was alone, because his body had betrayed him and his will let him down—it’s not apparent from the photograph. He is smiling in the picture, and there is no mistaking the look in his eyes: Chris McCandless was at peace, serene as a monk gone to God” (Krakauer, 199).</p><br>
			<p>This passage helps show the overarching theme of the novel. For example, when it says “Chris McCandless was at peace, serene as a monk gone to God”, even though he was literally dying,  you can see how happy he is to be finally fulfilling his goals. This contributes to the theme because to Chris his dream was that he wanted to go and explore the Alaskan wilderness to finally distance himself from society, so he was finally satisfying he yearning to be free.</p><br>
