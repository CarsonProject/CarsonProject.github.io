			<h2>Theme</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>The theme of <em>Into The Wild</em> is that rejection to the American materialistic view is a beneficial step into becoming a happy person for some people, but ultimately every person has their own goals and aspirations that will make them happy.</p><br>
			<h4>Passage and Response</h4>
			<p>“One of his last acts was to take a picture of himself, standing near the bus under the high Alaska sky, one hand holding his final note toward the camera lens, the other raised in a brave, beatific farewell. His face is horribly emaciated, almost skeletal. But if he pitied himself in those last difficult hours—because he was so young, because he was alone, because his body had betrayed him and his will let him down—it’s not apparent from the photograph. He is smiling in the picture, and there is no mistaking the look in his eyes: Chris McCandless was at peace, serene as a monk gone to God” (Krakauer, 199).</p><br>
			<p>This passage helps show the overarching theme of the novel. For example, when it says “Chris McCandless was at peace, serene as a monk gone to God”, even though he was literally dying,  you can see how happy he is to be finally fulfilling his goals. This contributes to the theme because to Chris his dream was that he wanted to go and explore the Alaskan wilderness to finally distance himself from society, so he was finally satisfying he yearning to be free.</p><br>
			<h4>Visual and Paragraph</h4>
			<img src = "image.JPG"><br>
			<p>This image is very powerful after reading <em>Into The Wild</em>. For example, when read in the context of the novel, you can tell that Chris wrote this near the end of his life when he realized he was stuck in the Alaskan wilderness with almost no way out, due to his lack of knowledge of the area, and the flooded river. This would be terrifying and cause a lot of introspection about Chris’s plan for happiness because of the prolonged struggle of the situation, so what may have given him happiness before has changed into something that he realized he didn’t like.</p><br>
			<h4>Poem and Paragraph</h4>
			<p>Happiness lies in good health<br>Not in accumulation of wealth<br>Happiness lies in caring for others<br>Like dear friends and brothers<br>Happiness lies in sharing<br>Not is amassing<br>Happiness is the state of mind<br>Nowhere else you can find<br>Enjoy the moment, live the life<br>Settle score and end the strife<br>Happiness is the journey not destination<br>Happiness Is doing what is your fascination<br>Happiness is doing what you like<br>Sleeping, walking, running and riding a bike<br>Happiness will come near<br>When you will venture without fear<br>Render service that you can<br>Live a life that adorn a man<br><em>- Shashikant Nishant Sharma</em><br>
			</p><br>
			<p>This poem is a great example of the theme of Into The Wild.  Chris found his true happiness from doing things he likes.  An example is how throughout the book Chris was the happiest when he was living without material commitment. This is important to the theme because he would have never gone onto his journey if he didn’t do what was making him happy. So this directly relates to the theme of <em>Into The Wild</em>.</p>

			<h2>Historical and Contemporary Influences</h2>
			<hr>
			<p><em>Into The Wild</em> functions as a great historical and contemporary influence. This is because of the time it was written, and also the subject matter. A huge thing that most likely influences the book was, the United States got hit by a snowstorm that essentially paralyzed the Midwest and Northern States. This was much like Alaska, because it is so far North that there is constantly snow other than a few weeks during the summer. This probably changed the way Krakauer thought about the setting. Also, there was a lot of political tension between the United States, and Iran, so much that the United Nations dismantled one of Iran’s chemical weapon factories.</p>

			<h2>Literary Components</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>I think that Krakauer's unique style really helps the reader follow the story better and help it be more intriguing. Krakauer uses third person narration to help the reader see what is happening to Chris from more of an objective viewpoint, so the reader is able to see all aspects of the situation and then make their own opinion.</p><br>
			<p>"Two framed photographs occupy the mantel in Carine McCandless's beach home..."(Krakauer, 13). This passage shows exceptional diction when Krakauer is describing her beach house. This use of diction allows the reader the ability of vividly imagining the beach house and having a better understanding of the setting. Where Krakauer says “occupy the mantel”, it shows the reader that they take up lots of space on the mantel.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>While reading this book, I realized that I am very attached to materialistic possessions, and it is my goal after reading this book to be more focused on having a fun time while not needing tangible things. Also, I learned that the best way to be truly happy is to just start whatever will make you happy. This is really important to me because I would usually say that I would do something in the future but then never do it. This book was one of my favorite reads this year, because I was able to applicate it to my life right away.</p><br>
